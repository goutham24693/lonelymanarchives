<h3>Circuit & Packet Switching:</h3>
<p>
Circuit switching is a method of implementing a telecommunications network in which two network nodes establish a dedicated communications channel (circuit) through the network before the nodes may communicate. The circuit functions as if the nodes were physically connected as with an electrical circuit.</p>
<p>
Packet switching is a method of grouping data which is transmitted over a digital network into packets which are made of a header and a payload. Data in the header is used by networking hardware to direct the packet to its destination where the payload is extracted and used by application software. Packet switching is the primary basis for data communications in computer networks worldwide.

<h3>Switches & Routers:</h3>
<p>
Switches create network and Routers connects networks.<br><br>
A network switch is a computer networking device that connects devices together on a computer network by using packet switching to receive, process, and forward data to the destination device.  In networks the switch is the device that filters and forwards packets between LAN segments. Traditional Switches operate at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI Reference Model. 
</p>
<p>
Routers is connected to at least two networks, commonly two LANs or WANs or a LAN and its ISP's network. Routers are located at gateways, the places where two or more networks connect. Routers use headers and forwarding tables to determine the best path for forwarding the packets, and they use protocols to communicate with each other and configure the best route between any two hosts. Routing operates at layer 3 of the OSI Reference Model.<br><br>
Switches and Routers use packet switching to transfer data in a network.
</p>
<h3>Firewall & Proxy:</h3>
<p>
A firewall is a network security device that grants or rejects network access to traffic flows between an untrusted zone (e.g., the Internet) and a trusted zone (e.g., a private or corporate network).
</p>
<p>In computer networks, a proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients seeking resources from other servers. A client connects to the proxy server, requesting some service, connection, web page, or other resource available from a different server and the proxy server evaluates the request as a way to simplify and control its complexity.
